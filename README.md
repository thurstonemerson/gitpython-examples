# Make Changes to Git Repository

Scripts showing examples of how to programmatically make changes to git repositories, including
the following types:

- creating a repository with a set of changes on random dates between a start and an end
- add a set of changes to an existing repository on random dates between a start and an end
- add a set of changes to an existing repository on incremental dates between a start and an end

An interesting learning exercise.
